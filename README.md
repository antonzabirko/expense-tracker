# Expense Tracker 
 
This application tracks finances on a daily basis. You can add, remove, and edit expenses and apply filters to view expenses. 
 
Created with React using Redux alongside [Andrew Mead](https://twitter.com/andrew_j_mead?lang=en)'s course. Full list of dependencies in package.json for now. 
 
 Please note that the github code is `nightly`, and the Heroku deploy is `versioned`. If you want the latest features: pull, compile, and run `node server/server.js`.
 
Hosted on Heroku as of 6/8! 🎉🎉🎉
