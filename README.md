# Expense Tracker 
 
This application tracks finances on a daily basis. You can add, remove, and edit expenses and apply filters to view expenses. 
 
Created with React using Redux alongside [Andrew Mead](https://twitter.com/andrew_j_mead?lang=en)'s course. Full list of dependencies in package.json for now. 
 
The application is not yet usable without a full build environment. If you'd like to run the code, pull the files and execute `yarn install` in the source directory. That should install all the dependencies - and keep in mind that the deps are experimental and not version limited. Execute `yarn test` and `yarn run dev-server` to start the application on localhost:<default_port>. 
 
To be hosted on Heroku~!
