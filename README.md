ExpenseMap is a tiny budget management app created to demonstrate the power of React with Redux.

## Features

* **Filter by date, by amount, or by a date range:** Expenses can be filtered by the date they were created in or by the amount of the expense (in descending order). An additional, parallel filter can be applied to show expenses within a range of dates.
* **Overview of Filtered Expenses:** An overview of expenses is given at all times. The overview includes the number of currently visible expenses and their total value.
* **Add/Edit/Remove Expenses:** Expenses can be added, edited, and removed.
* **Search:** Expenses can be searched by description.

## Installation
