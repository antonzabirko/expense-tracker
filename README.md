ExpenseMap is a tiny budget management app created to demonstrate the power of React with Redux.

## Features

* **Add/Edit/Remove Expenses:** Expenses can be added, edited, and removed.
* **Search:** Expenses can be searched by description.
* **Removal Confirmation:** Confirm expense removal with a modal pop-up.
